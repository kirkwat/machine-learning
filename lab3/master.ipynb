    "\n",
    "This data can be useful in identifying prediabetes or diabetes in patients and assisting doctors with making accurate observations from a variety of health indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, the CDC collects data from a health-related telephone survey called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data gathered from these surveys include information on “health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.” This dataset focuses on responses from 2015 and diabetes, a “prevalent chronic disease in the United States.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the ability to identify a patient with prediabetes or diabetes with increased efficiency and accuracy is the intention of analyzing this dataset. With this capability, a diabetes diagnosis can be reached at a faster rate compared to when a human makes the diagnosis. Diabetes is extremely common in the US as about 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes, and [about 1 in 5 people with diabetes don’t know they have it](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/spotlights/diabetes-facts-stats.html#:~:text=37.3%20million%20Americans%E2%80%94about%201,t%20know%20they%20have%20it.). In addition, 1 in 3 Americans have prediabetes, and [more than 8 in 10 adults with prediabetes don’t know they have it](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/spotlights/diabetes-facts-stats.html#:~:text=37.3%20million%20Americans%E2%80%94about%201,t%20know%20they%20have%20it.). Using this classifier, patients that might be at risk of diabetes can be brought to a doctor’s attention at a higher rate allowing for earlier medical care and attention.\n",
